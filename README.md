## Little summary
This project aims to model and predict the number of affairs a person has based on various independent variables. The project utilizes multinomial logistic regression, a statistical method that is used to model a multiclass categorical dependent variable.

## Status of the project
The project status is in progress!

## Dataset and libraries used
The data set used in this project is a simulated data set from the statsmodels library, which contains information about a sample of individuals such as their marriage rating, age, years married, number of children, religiousness, and education level.

## Specific goal
The goal of the project is to use this information to build a model that can predict the number of affairs a person is likely to have based on the independent variables. The independent variables are chosen based on their potential to affect the number of affairs, and the model is trained using these variables and the dependent variable (number of affairs).

## Steps
1. Data acquisition: The first step is to acquire the data that will be used in the project. In this case, the data is a simulated data set from the statsmodels library, which contains information about a sample of individuals such as their marriage rating, age, years married, number of children, religiousness, and education level.

2. Data preprocessing: The next step is to preprocess the data. This step typically includes cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, and creating new features if necessary.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): After the data has been preprocessed, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain a deeper understanding of the data. This step involves visualizing the data, identifying patterns and trends, and determining the distribution of the variables.

4. Model building: After the EDA, the model is built. In this case, a multinomial logistic regression model is used to predict the number of affairs based on the independent variables. This step includes selecting the independent variables, fitting the model, and tuning the model parameters if necessary.

5. Model evaluation: After the model has been built, it is evaluated using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine how well it is able to predict the number of affairs.

6. Model interpretation: The final step is to interpret the model and report the results. This includes analyzing the coefficients and p-values of the model and drawing conclusions about the relationships between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The report should include a summary of the model, including the coefficients, p-values, and other statistics.
